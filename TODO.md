### possible future features or fixes:

* with_tag should raise error when used outside have_tag
* add ability to have_form('/url', 'PUT') or have_form('/url', :PUT)
* intelligent check comments(make sure it is not searching inside comments)
* shouldn't show all markup in error message if it is too big
* order matching
* improve documentation, add more usage examples (look at changelog and code!)
